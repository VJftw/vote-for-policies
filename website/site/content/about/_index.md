Vote for Policies is a not-for-profit organisation run by volunteers. We are independent and have no connection with any political party or candidate in any way. Our mission is to increase turnout in elections. Our method for achieving this is by helping voters make an informed, unbiased decision about who to vote for. And it works. According to a [national poll in 2015](/blog/national-poll-from-tns-reveals-most-popular-policies/#impact) 35% are more likely to vote after using Vote for Policies.

We also run [Policy Tracker](https://policytracker.org.uk) - which tracks the progress of each manifesto promise from the government's manifesto.

### Who cares about policies if parties don't stick to their promises?

We realise that many people are disillusioned with politics and don’t see the point of “voting for policies” (or voting at all) if the parties won’t keep their promises. It’s understandable.

The Vote for Policies survey is the first step towards holding politicians to account. Once we as an electorate are more informed and engaged with what the parties have promised to do, the next step is to ensure our next government is accountable to their election promises. This is why we released our [Policy Tracker](https://policytracker.org.uk/) site after the 2017 general election.

### What makes Vote for Policies different?

There are other Voter Advice Applications (VAAs) available, most of which are based on a quiz format where users are asked for yes/no answers to questions like, "Should we nationalise the railways" or "Should we use nuclear energy?" These sites are helpful and very engaging - and we recommend you try them all.

What Vote for Policies does differently, is connect you with the actual policies being promised by each party, and allows you to compare them without knowing which party they're from.

Focussing on policies in this way not only helps us to make a more informed decision, it also helps ensure the manifestos are used fairly to hold parties to account (for example, via our [Policy Tracker](https://policytracker.org.uk) site). We believe this is the path to a better democracy.
