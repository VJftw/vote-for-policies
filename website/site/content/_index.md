[43%]() didn’t vote in the last general election. That’s 24 million people.

To build a society that works for everyone, everyone should have a say in what happens – and have access to the truth. That’s how democracy should work – but we haven’t designed it that way.

We want to redesign our democracy by removing the barriers that stop people having their say, and staying informed.

Vote for Policies runs two services in the UK to help people get more informed about the issues they care about:

Our pre-election survey has been used 3 million times to give people more confidence to vote by knowing what they are voting for.
Our Tracker tracks the progress of the government’s manifesto promises.
